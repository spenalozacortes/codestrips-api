# Codestrips API

SQL-backed, fully persistent API with Express.js and Node.SQLite.

Codestrips is a small application to allow users to create and save small one-pane comic strips. You can select a head, body, background location, thought/speech bubble type, thought/speech bubble text, and caption for a strip. 

This is a Codecademy project.
